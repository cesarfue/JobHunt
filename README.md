## Overengineered Job Search

Tired of sending dozens of cover letters to get an internship ? Scared of waiting 6 months to get an entry-level job ? Well this repo isn't for you. Just for me. 

OverengineeredJobSearch automates (my) job applications by generating customized resumes and cover letters. It involves : 

- A Flask backend
- A Chrome extension frontend
- My resume in React
- And it keeps track of the applications in a excel sheet.
